    "We have provided you with some code and parts of the article [The Mayweather-McGregor Fight, As Told Through Emojis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mayweather-mcgregor-fight-as-told-through-emojis/). This article is based on the dataset:\n",

[tweets](data/tweets.csv) Created by FiveThirtyEight with the Twitter Streaming API containing a sample of all the tweets that matched the search terms: #MayMac, #MayweatherMcGregor, #MayweatherVMcGregor, #MayweatherVsMcGregor, #McGregor and #Mayweather collected between 12:05 a.m. and 1:15 a.m. EDT, 12,118 that had emojis. Available [on github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/mayweather-mcgregor)\n",

For the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, we provide some example code to get the data into the right structure. The points for each visualization are distributed: (30 points: 9 (1st problem) + 7 (each of 2nd, 3rd & 4th)).\n",

    "*IMPORTANT BROWSER ISSUE*: For some non-ES6 Browsers there are problems with date/time conversions (see [this](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/times_and_dates.html)). If things aren't working try something like Chrome for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT DATA ISSUE*: There are some differences in the data that 538 used and what we have. This will cause some issues to how things are normalized. Things should look very similar, but you may find, for example, that the scale of tweets when you normalize is different than the original figure. This is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT STYLING/ANNOTATION* NOTE: Part of this assignment is to get styling and annotation to be as close to 538 as possible. Altair and Vega-Lite aren't super helpful for annotation purposes. You will find that you need to do things like layering text and the arrows (hint: see [here](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/1721)). What I usually do in practice (when I need the visualization to look good and have annotation) is get things as close to how I want them to look, export the image as an SVG and then load it into [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/), or [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). You can see \"reasonably close approximations\" in the examples we provide. Those have been generated using nothing but Altair."

    "To the surprise of many (of the neutral and pro-Mayweather viewers, anyway) McGregor won the first round. The next couple were washes, and a quarter of the way into the [scheduled 12 rounds](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/26/sports/mayweather-mcgregor.html) … the Irish underdog may have been winning! The Irish flags and shamrocks followed on Twitter. Things slowly (perhaps even 😴ly) turned around as one of the best pound-for-pound boxers in history took control of the man making his pro debut — an outcome which was predicted by precisely everyone. Out came the emoji money bags."

Mayweather unleashed a vicious flurry of punches in the 10th and the ref stepped in, declaring Mayweather the victor and saving McGregor, who was somehow still on his feet, from further damage."

    "It ended just over 37 minutes after it began. Five seconds later, Mayweather leapt up on the corner ropes, victorious — [50-0](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mayweather-is-defined-by-the-zero-next-to-his-name/). Some observers declared it a [satisfying spectacle](https://www.si.com/boxing/2017/08/27/after-months-hype-mayweather-and-mcgregor-deliver-boxing-spectacle). Others, McGregor chief among them, [were frustrated with the finish](https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/conor-mcgregor-frustrated-with-refs-fight-stoppage-let-the-man-put-me-down/). The emoji users on Twitter appeared to think the fight was, for the most part, 🔥 — especially as it heated up toward the end. While the result may never have been in question, this was a welcome outcome for many who viewed Mayweather’s last megafight against Manny Pacquiao as an epic 😴😴😴😴."
